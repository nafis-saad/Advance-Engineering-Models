Certainly cheaper than taking either an Uber or a Lyft, too. Bikes seem pretty well maintained for the most part, also. The MoGo boost e-bikes are an even better option for those of us who don't want our personal e-bikes nicked while visiting the D, which can happen in ANY major city, as well as those of us who might struggle to get a regular bike onto a bike rack of a transit bus.\\n\\nIf you have a monthly/annual/access pass, you can ride for an hour before being charged 25\\u00a2 per minute. This is plenty of time if you want to ride from downtown to Belle Isle. If you want more time, dock before the hour is up, and then grab another bike.\\n\\nFrom what I can tell, all the bikes are step-through models, so they're easy to get on and off. The regular bike has a three speed twist shifter, while the MoGo Boost is single speed with pedal assist, has no throttle, and the motor cuts off at 15 mph which is plenty fast for urban riding. Simple to operate for a novice, yet a lot of fun.\"\u001b[39;49;00m,\n",

With the Daily pass, as you stated (and this was posted in multiple places), you had to dock the bike every 30 minutes in. order to avoid overage fees. Since you didn't, you were appropriately charged for the rides you took, so there's no scam. However, we're happy to announce that this sort of confusion is why we recently eliminated the $8 Daily Pass, and replaced it with two fun and less confusing options: Pay As You Go, which is $1 to unlock and 25 cents per minute, and Prepaid, which is $18 for two hours of ride time.
